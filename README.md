# NRP_FindMelodyGA
Lab 2 - Unconventional Computing Procedures (NRP) on University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb - Find Melody Genetic Algorithm. Created by Tomislav Horvat and Ivan Piščević.
For the genetic programming we used "DEAP" python library and for playing the notes we used "musicalbeeps" library. 
We used a special gene structure, which consists of note value (notes from A to H), octave value (from 0 to 9) and riser or discounter values (# or *b*). 
Finding of given note length isnt implemented.
